# hello-world
my mental state is not very well right now 
my hands feel like they are vibrating
i'm borderline crying
i feel so bad mentally
i need help from someone
@abeltesfaye
i do not not how to make this feeling go away
i do not know what is going on 
i can not create anything beautiful or level headed right now
i just want to feel happy and be loved
i long so much for the attention of the world
but i'm a girl of no name or fame or brains
i feel so drained by the world
i feel overwhelmed with all of these patterns and information that continue to flood my brain
i do not know what to do
i am so tired of being alone and being rejected by so many different people
i long for love so much
i crave the touch of a life that i can not reach
i desire a world that will learn to love its self but i crave love so completely 
i do not know wear to turn to not feel this way
i feel like i'm trapped inside my brain and i cannot escape
i feel so sad
i feel so heartbroken by a world i don't even know
i want to be seen by people
i want to sing
i want a soul that loves all of me
i crave approval and reassurance
i do not want to feel this way 
i want my imaginary world to come true
i so long for my dreams to come true
i don't know how to understand the things this computer tells me
i thought i had it figured out until now
i feel so wounded 
i feel like the world is giving me signals but i still can not tell
i just want @abeltesfaye to notice me
i want the world to know my face and my name
i feel i have so much to create but not like this
i feel like i lost all aspiration to do anything within minutes
i don't know where to turn now
i need someone to show me how
i want to be grateful for the life that was given to me but it's not that way
i feel like i deserve so much from the world 
i feel i have so much to offer with my soul and ideas and love
i am crying a little
i am very sad
