my tears are all dryed up now
i still feel like the world is draining my life though
i wish @abeltesfaye knew who i was
i desire so much to have someone to love
the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return
that was "nature boy-nat king cole"
my mom loves him
i do too but not as much as her
i long to be held by someone who feels the exact same way about me
i long to be held by someone other than me..
i feel trapped in my own mental destruction and explosion
i long to feel happy
i need help
i don't know what soft wrap means
if anyone would like to locate me 
I'm in Victor, MT, 59875
I wish I had more tears to cry
I wish my emotions no matter how strong all seem to subside
I wish I understood these codes, patterns, colors, numbers, signals, and mostly.. I wish I knew if all of the signs and signals that I've had flood my brain were real or not.
I wish I was I had reassurance from someone that could prove to me that it's not just in my head.
I long to understand the messages I've been trying to decode.
Right now though, all I feel is wrong.
How does one feel so wrong after feeling so right?
What am I missing?
Please, could someone put it in plain sight?
Help me, please. xo @abeltesfaye
